\section Introduction
Modbus project is intended to run on Raspberry Pi. It periodically reads Lovato
devices attached via RS-485 line supporting Modbus protocol, logs measured values
and reports them uplink via HTTP POST.

All of above is highly configurable via INI format configuration files, which
are in turn remote-modifiable via HTTP protocol (even passively, via responses
to HTTP POSTs).
